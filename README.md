# Intro

This plugin extends Templater to interact with large language models. It is primarily designed to work with OpenAI LLMs, like the ones used by ChatGPT, but is also compatible with any LLM that supports the OpenAI API.

For example, in Templater, you can use the following command to ask ChatGPT a question:

`<%tp.ai.chat("How far is the moon from the earth?")%>`

For detailed instructions on the use of this plugin, please see: [https://tfthacker.com/AIT]

Please note that this plugin requires an API key from OpenAI. You can get one by signing up at [https://beta.openai.com/signup/].

Additionally, when you use this plugin, unless you have configured it to use a local LLM, it will make internt requests to the OpenAI API. Please be aware of this when using this plugin.
