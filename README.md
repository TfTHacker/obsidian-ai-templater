# Intro

This plugin extends Templater to interact with large language models. It is primarily designed to work with OpenAI LLMs, like the ones used by ChatGPT, but is also compatible with any LLM that supports the OpenAI API.

For example, in Templater, you can use the following command to ask ChatGPT a question:

`<%tp.ai.chat("How far is the moon from the earth?")%>`
